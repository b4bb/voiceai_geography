# Replicate core application for Eleven Labs
_Exported on 8/8/2025 at 19:26:27 PDT from Cursor (1.3.9)_

** Goal
My goal is to replicate a core application for Eleven Labs voice agent integration, and remove redundant code without impacting the core application.  

Below is more information, including what I see as the core application.

** Relevant Project
Directory: /Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git 
Run commands
NPM
Directory: /Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/
Command: npm run dev
Python
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/backend 
python3 -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 3000

** Core App
Website for app: http://localhost:8080/
This website represents what I have called the “core application”.
Core application is the webpage that is displayed at this url, and the buttons on the webpage for interaction with Eleven Labs agent

** Source
This code was obtained from Eleven Labs Github repository:
https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/
Readme: https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/blob/main/README.md 
The app 
https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/conversational-ai 

** Example
The core app falls is based on the Conversational AI example from ElevenLabs, which seems to be (I could be wrong) in these two directories
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git/examples/conversational-ai/python/convai

** Prior Work
For this project, Cursor had to spend significant time in getting the Elevenlabs integration to work.  Thus be very careful when touching any code (Python or Javascript) that supports the Elevenlabs integration.

Is this request clear?  Is it feasible?

Let me analyze your request and break it down to ensure I understand correctly.

Your goal is to:
1. Identify and preserve the core functionality of the ElevenLabs voice agent integration
2. Remove redundant code while ensuring the core functionality remains intact
3. Be extremely careful with code that handles ElevenLabs integration due to its complexity

The core application consists of:
1. Frontend (JavaScript):
   - Located at `/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/`
   - Runs on `http://localhost:8080`
   - Contains the web interface and interaction buttons

2. Backend (Python):
   - Located at `/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/backend/`
   - Runs on port 3000
   - Handles ElevenLabs API integration

Let me first examine the core files to understand what's essential:

Based on my analysis, this request is feasible. Here's what I see as the core components that must be preserved:

1. Core Frontend Components (app.js):
   - WebSocket connection management with ElevenLabs
   - Dynamic variables handling
   - Microphone permission management
   - Basic UI controls (start/end buttons)
   - Status updates and error handling

2. Core Backend Components (server.py):
   - Signed URL generation for WebSocket connection
   - API key and agent ID management
   - Basic error handling and logging
   - CORS configuration

The core functionality appears to be well-isolated and modular. Here's my suggested approach:

1. First Phase (Analysis):
   - Document all dependencies and their purposes
   - Map the data flow between frontend and backend
   - Identify any redundant or unnecessary code

2. Second Phase (Cleanup):
   - Remove any unused routes or endpoints
   - Consolidate error handling
   - Clean up logging statements
   - Remove any experimental or development-only code

3. Third Phase (Testing):
   - Test each core functionality after changes
   - Verify WebSocket connections still work
   - Ensure dynamic variables are properly passed
   - Check error handling still functions

Would you like me to proceed with a detailed analysis of what can be safely removed or simplified while preserving the core functionality?

I notice that port 3000 is still in use and needs to be cleared before we can proceed. Let me help you stop any running processes and then we'll fix the dynamic variables implementation.

Let's first clean up any running processes:

1. Stop the frontend server if it's running:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where webpack is running
   ```

2. Stop the backend server and clear port 3000:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where uvicorn is running
   lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```

Now, let's make the necessary changes to fix the dynamic variables. I'll read the current state of `app.js`:

```shellscript
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where webpack is running
```

```shellscript
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where uvicorn is running
   lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

I see that the code is already using `dynamicVariables` correctly in the `startSession` configuration (lines 92-94). However, we need to make a few adjustments to ensure it's working properly:

1. Remove the separate logging of dynamic variables (lines 77-79)
2. Add more detailed WebSocket message logging
3. Add validation for the dynamic variables before sending

Here's how we should modify the code:

```javascript:app.js
// ... existing code ...

async function startConversation() {
    const startButton = document.getElementById('startButton');
    const endButton = document.getElementById('endButton');
    
    try {
        const hasPermission = await requestMicrophonePermission();
        if (!hasPermission) {
            alert('Microphone permission is required for the conversation.');
            return;
        }

        const signedUrl = await getSignedUrl();
        
        // Define dynamic variables
        const dynamicVars = {
            customer_name: "Global Jane"
        };
        
        // Log the configuration and WebSocket details
        console.log('%c Dynamic Variables:', 'color: #4CAF50; font-weight: bold', dynamicVars);
        console.log('%c WebSocket URL:', 'color: #9C27B0; font-weight: bold', signedUrl);

        // Initialize the conversation with dynamic variables
        conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
            signedUrl: signedUrl,
            dynamicVariables: dynamicVars,
            onConnect: () => {
                console.log('%c WebSocket Connected', 'color: #2196F3; font-weight: bold');
                console.log('%c Session Config:', 'color: #FF9800; font-weight: bold', {
                    dynamicVariables: dynamicVars,
                    url: signedUrl
                });
                updateStatus(true);
                startButton.disabled = true;
                endButton.disabled = false;
            },
            onMessage: (message) => {
                console.log('%c Agent Response:', 'color: #E91E63; font-weight: bold', {
                    message,
                    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
                });
            }
            // ... existing event handlers ...
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to start conversation:', error);
        
        if (error.error?.code === 'validation_error') {
            const missingVars = error.error.details?.missing_variables || [];
            console.error('Missing dynamic variables:', missingVars);
            alert(`Missing required dynamic variables: ${missingVars.join(', ')}`);
        } else {
            alert('Failed to start conversation. Please try again.');
        }
    }
}

// ... existing code ...
```

The key changes are:
1. Created a separate `dynamicVars` object for better reusability and consistency
2. Added more detailed logging of the WebSocket session configuration
3. Enhanced message logging to include timestamps
4. Removed redundant status element HTML modification
5. Kept the core dynamic variables structure intact

Would you like me to apply these changes to the file? Also, we should verify that the backend server is properly configured to handle these dynamic variables.

```javascript
// ... existing code ...

async function startConversation() {
    const startButton = document.getElementById('startButton');
    const endButton = document.getElementById('endButton');
    
    try {
        const hasPermission = await requestMicrophonePermission();
        if (!hasPermission) {
            alert('Microphone permission is required for the conversation.');
            return;
        }

        const signedUrl = await getSignedUrl();
        
        // Define dynamic variables
        const dynamicVars = {
            customer_name: "Global Jane"
        };
        
        // Log the configuration and WebSocket details
        console.log('%c Dynamic Variables:', 'color: #4CAF50; font-weight: bold', dynamicVars);
        console.log('%c WebSocket URL:', 'color: #9C27B0; font-weight: bold', signedUrl);

        // Initialize the conversation with dynamic variables
        conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
            signedUrl: signedUrl,
            dynamicVariables: dynamicVars,

                    dynamicVariables: dynamicVars,
                    url: signedUrl
                });
                updateStatus(true);
                startButton.disabled = true;
                endButton.disabled = false;
            },

                    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
                });
            }

        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to start conversation:', error);

**User**

Can you list the directories (highest level) that will be removed?

---

**Cursor**

Let me analyze the project structure to identify directories that can be safely removed without affecting the core ElevenLabs voice agent integration.

Looking at the root directory `/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/`, I see these main directories:

1. `backup-enrollment/` - Can be removed (not related to ElevenLabs)
2. `backup-todo-list/` - Can be removed (not related to ElevenLabs)
3. `elevenlabs-example-git/` - Contains the core functionality (KEEP)
4. `enrollment/` - Can be removed (not related to ElevenLabs)
5. `todo-list/` - Can be removed (not related to ElevenLabs)
6. `voice-chat-app/` - Can be removed (separate app, not part of core ElevenLabs example)

Within `elevenlabs-example-git/examples/`, we can also remove several non-core directories, but let's focus on the highest level first.

To summarize, these top-level directories can be removed:
```
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/
├── backup-enrollment/     (REMOVE)
├── backup-todo-list/     (REMOVE)
├── elevenlabs-example-git/ (KEEP - contains core functionality)
├── enrollment/           (REMOVE)
├── todo-list/           (REMOVE)
└── voice-chat-app/      (REMOVE)
```

Would you like me to also analyze which subdirectories within `elevenlabs-example-git/examples/` can be removed while preserving the core conversational AI functionality?

```plaintext
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/
├── backup-enrollment/     (REMOVE)
├── backup-todo-list/     (REMOVE)
├── elevenlabs-example-git/ (KEEP - contains core functionality)
├── enrollment/           (REMOVE)
├── todo-list/           (REMOVE)
└── voice-chat-app/      (REMOVE)
```

---

**User**

Yes.  All other directories in /Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/ can be ignored.  They are for other projects.

---

**Cursor**

Great, then let's focus on analyzing the subdirectories within `elevenlabs-example-git/examples/` to identify what can be safely removed while preserving the core conversational AI functionality.

Let me check the structure of the examples directory:

Based on your core application needs, here's what we can keep vs. remove in `elevenlabs-example-git/examples/`:

KEEP:
1. `conversational-ai/` - This is your core functionality
   - Specifically the `javascript/` and its `backend/` subdirectories

REMOVE (not part of core voice agent integration):
1. `audio-native/` - Native audio implementations
2. `dubbing/` - Audio dubbing examples
3. `pronunciation-dictionaries/` - Dictionary management
4. `sound-effects/` - Sound effects processing
5. `speech-to-text/` - Speech recognition
6. `text-to-speech/` - Basic TTS without conversation
7. `text-to-speech-websockets/` - WebSocket TTS examples
8. `text-to-voice/` - Voice conversion
9. `twilio/` - Twilio integration examples
10. `websockets/` - Generic WebSocket examples
11. `ElevenLabs Mac Helper app/` - Desktop app example

So your final structure should look like:
```
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git/
├── examples/
│   └── conversational-ai/
│       ├── javascript/          # Core frontend
│       │   ├── src/
│       │   │   └── app.js      # Main application code
│       │   └── backend/        # Core backend
│       │       ├── server.py   # Server implementation
│       │       └── .env        # Configuration
│       └── python/             # Alternative Python implementation (can be removed if not needed)
└── [other files]
```

Would you like me to help you create a script to safely remove these directories while preserving the core functionality?

```plaintext
/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/elevenlabs-example-git/

**User**

Do I need to switch to Agent mode (from Ask) before I ask you (Cursor) to the work of remving directories and making code changes?

---

**Cursor**

No, you don't need to switch to Agent mode. Both Ask and Agent modes in Cursor can handle file operations and code changes. However, there are currently known issues with file editing tools in Cursor (as we saw in the previous chat), so we should:

1. First, make a backup of your core functionality:
   ```
   elevenlabs-example-git/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/
   ├── src/
   │   └── app.js
   └── backend/
       ├── server.py
       └── .env
   ```

2. Then we can proceed with removing the non-core directories and making code changes in either Ask or Agent mode.

3. If we encounter issues with file editing tools again, we can:
   - Provide you with the exact code changes to make manually
   - Try alternative approaches like creating new files instead of modifying existing ones
   - Use version control (git) to track and revert changes if needed

Would you like to proceed with removing the non-core directories first, or would you prefer to fix the dynamic variables issue first?

   elevenlabs-example-git/examples/conversational-ai/javascript/

   │   └── app.js
   └── backend/
       ├── server.py
       └── .env
```

**User**

Please do not make any changes to the elevenlabs-example-git directory.  Create a new project (directory) in cursor-test called "voiceai-geography".  Copy need directories and / or files to this directory (or subdirectory within this directory).  Make code changes only to the files that are under voiceai-geography directory.  Is that clear?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, that's very clear. We'll:

1. Create a new project directory `voiceai-geography` in `cursor-test`
2. Copy only the necessary files from `elevenlabs-example-git` to maintain the core voice agent functionality
3. Make all code changes only in the new `voiceai-geography` directory
4. Keep the original `elevenlabs-example-git` untouched as a reference

Let me create the new directory structure:

Now, let's create the necessary subdirectories and copy the core files:

Now, let's copy the core files we need:

Let me verify the structure of our new project:

Perfect! I've created the new project structure:

```
voiceai-geography/
├── package.json           # Project configuration
├── webpack.config.js      # Webpack configuration
└── src/
    ├── frontend/         
    │   └── app.js        # Frontend application code
    └── backend/
        ├── server.py     # Backend server
        ├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
        └── .env          # Environment variables
```

Now we can:
1. Make any necessary code changes to the files in `voiceai-geography`
2. Keep the original `elevenlabs-example-git` untouched
3. Implement the dynamic variables fix in the new location

Would you like me to proceed with updating the dynamic variables implementation in the new location?

**User**

I see that demo.py has not been copied.  This file has the AGENT_ID and API_KEY initiatization.  Is this code not needed, ie. the initialization is happening somewhere else?

---

**Cursor**

Let me check where the AGENT_ID and API_KEY initialization is happening in our new project structure.

First, let me check the backend server code:

Let me also check if the `.env` file was copied correctly:

I see what's happening:

1. The initialization of `AGENT_ID` and `API_KEY` is already handled in `server.py` using environment variables (lines 27-28):
   ```python
   agent_id = os.getenv("AGENT_ID")
   xi_api_key = os.getenv("XI_API_KEY")
   ```

2. However, the `.env` file wasn't copied correctly. We need to create it in our new project. Let me copy the environment variables from the original `.env` file:

```python
   agent_id = os.getenv("AGENT_ID")
   xi_api_key = os.getenv("XI_API_KEY")
```

I see. Due to security restrictions, we can't write the `.env` file directly. You'll need to create the `.env` file manually in `/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/voiceai-geography/src/backend/` with these contents:

```
AGENT_ID=agent_5101k1vsey8seajt4jtzbgtppfwt
XI_API_KEY=sk_26332db148821db36676ec0d24982ab992bdfc37eee7feb9
```

To answer your question:
1. No, we don't need to copy `demo.py` because the API key and agent ID initialization is already handled in `server.py` using environment variables
2. The Python backend server (`server.py`) reads these values from the `.env` file and uses them to:
   - Get the signed URL from ElevenLabs API
   - Handle agent ID requests for public agents
3. The frontend JavaScript code doesn't need direct access to these values because it gets the signed URL from our backend server

Would you like me to help you set up the `.env` file or is there anything else you'd like me to explain?

```plaintext
AGENT_ID=agent_5101k1vsey8seajt4jtzbgtppfwt
XI_API_KEY=sk_26332db148821db36676ec0d24982ab992bdfc37eee7feb9
```

```

**User**

I have created the .env file.

Great! Now that you've created the `.env` file in `/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/voiceai-geography/src/backend/.env`, let's verify that all the necessary files are in place and then start the servers.

First, let me check if we have all the required files in our new project:

Let me check the frontend and backend directories:

Now let's start the servers. First, let's make sure no processes are using port 3000:

Now let's start the backend server:

And in a new terminal, let's start the frontend server:

**User**

backend server shows error

---

**Cursor**

Ah, I see the error. The backend server is looking for a `dist` directory that doesn't exist yet. This is because we need to:

1. Fix the directory structure in `server.py` - it's looking for `../dist` but our structure is different now
2. Create the necessary directories for static files

Let me fix this:

Let me create the necessary directories and fix the paths:

Now let's update the server.py file to point to the correct directory:

Now let's copy the necessary frontend files (index.html and styles.css) from the original project:

Now let's try starting the backend server again:

---

**User**

Backend server started

---

**Cursor**

Great! The backend server is now running successfully. Next, we need to set up and start the frontend server. First, let's check if we have all the necessary frontend configuration files:

Now let's install the npm dependencies:

Now let's start the frontend development server:

---

**User**

Does it matter which directory I am in for running this command?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, it does matter! For the `npm run dev` command, you need to be in the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located. Let me check your current directory and the project structure:

---

**User**

Got an error

---

**Cursor**

I see several issues from the error output:

1. The backend path is incorrect in package.json (it's looking for `/backend` instead of `/src/backend`)
2. Webpack can't find the source files because they're in `/src/frontend` but it's looking in `/src`
3. The static files are in the wrong location

Let me fix these issues:

1. First, let's update the package.json:

2. Now let's check the webpack config:

Let me fix these configurations:

1. Update package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "elevenlabs-conversational-ai-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Simple demo of ElevenLabs Conversational AI SDK",
  "scripts": {
    "start:backend": "cd src/backend && python3 -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 3000",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run start:backend\" \"webpack serve --mode development\"",
    "start": "npm run build && npm run start:backend"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@elevenlabs/client": "latest",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.28.0",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.28.0",
    "babel-loader": "^10.0.0",
    "concurrently": "^8.0.1",

    "webpack": "^5.88.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^4.15.1"
  }
}

```

2. Update webpack.config.js:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/frontend/app.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'static/bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        publicPath: '/'
    },
    devServer: {
        static: {
            directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
        },
        port: 8080,
        proxy: {
            '/api': 'http://localhost:3000'
        },
        hot: true
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new CopyPlugin({
            patterns: [
                { from: 'src/index.html', to: 'index.html' },
                { from: 'src/styles.css', to: 'static/styles.css' }
            ],
        }),
    ]
};

```

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/frontend/app.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'static/bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        publicPath: '/'
    },
    devServer: {
        static: {
            directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
        },
        port: 8080,
        proxy: {
            '/api': 'http://localhost:3000'
        },
        hot: true
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new CopyPlugin({
            patterns: [
                { from: 'src/frontend/dist/index.html', to: 'index.html' },
                { from: 'src/frontend/dist/styles.css', to: 'static/styles.css' }
            ],
        }),
    ]
};

```

Now try running the frontend server again:

---

**User**

error

---

**Cursor**

Yes, I see the error: `[Errno 48] Address already in use`. This means port 3000 is still being used by our previous backend server instance. Let's fix this:

1. First, let's kill any process using port 3000:

Now try running the development server again:

The servers should now start properly. You should be able to access:
- Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- Backend: http://localhost:3000

Let me know if you see any other errors or if you'd like me to explain any part of the setup.

---

**User**

errors

---

**Cursor**

I see the issue - you're currently in the `/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test` directory, but you need to be in the `/Users/arshadsiddiqi/dev/cursor-test/voiceai-geography` directory where the `package.json` file is located.

Let's change to the correct directory and try again:

The command should work now because:
1. We're in the correct directory (`voiceai-geography`) where `package.json` exists
2. The port 3000 was cleared earlier
3. All the necessary configuration files are in place

You should see both servers starting up. Let me know if you see any other errors!

---

**User**

No errors.  The website is working as expected. 

---

**Cursor**

Great! The application is now running successfully with:
1. Backend server on http://localhost:3000
2. Frontend server on http://localhost:8080
3. Proper API communication (as seen from the successful signed URL request)
4. All static files being served correctly

To summarize what we've accomplished:
1. Created a new clean project structure in `voiceai-geography`
2. Set up the environment variables correctly
3. Fixed the directory paths in webpack and package.json configurations
4. Successfully started both servers

Would you like to:
1. Make any changes to the dynamic variables implementation?
2. Test any specific functionality?
3. Make any other modifications to the application?

Let me know what you'd like to do next!

---

**User**

Explain what are the core components of this project -- such as Python, Node etc.

---

**Cursor**

Let me break down the core components of this project:

1. Backend (Python):
   - Framework: FastAPI (Python web framework)
   - Key Files:
     - `src/backend/server.py`: Main server file handling API endpoints
     - `src/backend/.env`: Environment variables (AGENT_ID and XI_API_KEY)
     - `src/backend/requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
   - Main Functions:
     - Generates signed URLs for WebSocket connections
     - Handles API key management
     - Provides CORS support
     - Serves static files

2. Frontend (Node.js/JavaScript):
   - Framework: Vanilla JavaScript with Webpack
   - Key Files:
     - `src/frontend/app.js`: Main application logic
     - `src/frontend/dist/index.html`: Main webpage
     - `src/frontend/dist/styles.css`: Styling
   - Build Tools:
     - Webpack for bundling and development server
     - Babel for JavaScript compatibility

3. Development Environment:
   - Package Management:
     - Python: pip/venv (virtual environment)
     - Node.js: npm
   - Development Servers:
     - Backend: Uvicorn (ASGI server) on port 3000
     - Frontend: Webpack Dev Server on port 8080

4. Key Dependencies:
   - Python Side:
     ```
     fastapi
     uvicorn
     python-dotenv
     httpx
     ```
   - Node.js Side:
     ```
     @elevenlabs/client
     webpack
     babel
     concurrently (runs both servers)
     ```

5. Architecture:
   ```
   Client (Browser) ←→ Webpack Dev Server (8080)
                         ↓
                     FastAPI Server (3000)
                         ↓
                     ElevenLabs API
   ```
   - Frontend communicates with backend via `/api` endpoints
   - Backend communicates with ElevenLabs API
   - WebSocket connection established directly between client and ElevenLabs

6. Development Workflow:
   - `npm run dev` starts both servers concurrently
   - Backend auto-reloads on Python file changes
   - Frontend hot-reloads on JavaScript/CSS changes

Would you like me to explain any of these components in more detail?

```plaintext
     fastapi
     uvicorn

     concurrently (runs both servers)
```

```plaintext
   Client (Browser) ←→ Webpack Dev Server (8080)
                         ↓
                     FastAPI Server (3000)
                         ↓
                     ElevenLabs API
```

**User**

Create a README file with relevant information, such as how to run the two servers.

---

**Cursor**

I'll create a comprehensive README.md file for the project:

```markdown
# VoiceAI Geography

A web application that integrates with ElevenLabs' conversational AI for geography-related interactions.

## Project Structure

```
voiceai-geography/
├── src/
│   ├── frontend/         # Frontend JavaScript application
│   │   ├── app.js       # Main application logic
│   │   └── dist/        # Static files (HTML, CSS)
│   └── backend/         # Python FastAPI backend
│       ├── server.py    # Main server file

│       └── requirements.txt
├── package.json         # Node.js dependencies
└── webpack.config.js    # Webpack configuration
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- Python virtual environment (recommended)

## Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create `.env` file in `src/backend/` with your ElevenLabs credentials:
   ```
   AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
   XI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

You can start both servers simultaneously using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on http://localhost:3000
- Frontend application on http://localhost:8080

### Starting Servers Separately

To run the backend server only:
```bash
cd src/backend
python3 -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 3000
```

To run the frontend server only:
```bash
webpack serve --mode development
```

## Development

- Backend code changes will automatically reload the server
- Frontend changes will trigger hot-reload in the browser
- API endpoints are proxied from :8080 to :3000

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/signed-url`: Gets a signed URL for WebSocket connection
- `GET /api/getAgentId`: Returns the configured agent ID
- Static files are served from the `/static` directory

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in `src/backend/.env`:
- `AGENT_ID`: Your ElevenLabs agent ID
- `XI_API_KEY`: Your ElevenLabs API key

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI (Python web framework)
  - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
  - python-dotenv (environment variables)
  - httpx (HTTP client)

- **Frontend**:
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - @elevenlabs/client
  - Webpack (bundling and development)
  - Babel (JavaScript compatibility)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Backend: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Frontend: `npm install`

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists in `src/backend/`
   - Check that AGENT_ID and XI_API_KEY are set correctly
```

I've created a comprehensive README.md that includes:
1. Project structure and setup instructions
2. How to run both servers
3. Environment configuration
4. Troubleshooting tips
5. List of technologies used
6. API endpoints information

Would you like me to:
1. Add any additional sections to the README?
2. Create any additional documentation?
3. Make any modifications to the existing content?
